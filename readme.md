# Luggage Product Sales Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of data science models to predict the "bought in last month" figure for a range of luggage products. The project leverages a dataset containing features such as product title, customer ratings, number of reviews, prices, and sales figures. It explores various models, including linear regression and neural networks, to understand and predict customer purchasing behavior.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing and Exploration: Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the dataset for better understanding and insights.
- Regression Models: Implementing models like linear regression to predict sales figures.
- Neural Network Implementation: Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras to build and train neural networks for more complex predictions.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, matplotlib, seaborn
